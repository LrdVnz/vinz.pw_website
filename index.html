			<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Vinz, I'm learning web development on my own. I have no past experience.
			 Although I really like it so far. 
			 I want to build this site to get experience and something of my own,
			  and also to share the project and my learning journey. It's fun.

			<h2>TIC TAC TOE</h2>
			<p>
				This project took longer than I expected, and I had to look things up.
				It was a great challenge overall, especially in how to deal with problems. 
				The first thing it needs is the board. I : 
			<ul> 
				<li> Initially created it as an hash of arrays</li>
				<li> then rewrote it as an array of arrays</li>
				<li> then , looking up a solution, I said "why does it need to be complicated? " and I just did a normal array. much easier</li>
            </ul>				
				The goal was to make two players play against themselves. I also tried to put in a player vs cpu mode, at the end I gave up, it was getting too much. 
				- Keep the focus on the main goal
				
				This is Object Oriented Programming, so we need to create classes.
				 My solution has a main "Game" class that basically holds everything.
				<ul> 
				 <li>"startgame" well, it.... starts the game . And has the loop that keeps it running</li>
				 <li>call_put prompts the player for a position, and calls put_sign</li>
				<li> put_sign , puts the sign if the cell is empty(else it recalls call_put) then calls showboard, win and full_board</li>
				 <li>showboard shows the board in the terminal</li>
				 <li>win checks if the current sign has a winning combination present in the board </li>
				 <li>full_board.</li>
				<li>then there is the Player class. It only holds the sign.</li> 
				end. 
				Great challenging project for OOP
